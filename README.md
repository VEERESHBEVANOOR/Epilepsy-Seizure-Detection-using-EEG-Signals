# Epilepsy-Seizure-Detection-using-EEG-Signals
A machine learning–based system designed to automatically detect epileptic seizures using EEG (electroencephalogram) brain signals. The project processes EEG data, extracts meaningful features, and classifies brain activity as either seizure or non-seizure in real time.
